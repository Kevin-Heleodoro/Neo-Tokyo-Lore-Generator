-   Added mock up route for generating backstory and openAi API key

### 2024-01-10

-   Fixed the alchemyDataService in Frontend. I needed to set the methods to `async` and then `await` the calls.
-   Created first iteration of Header.
-   Created first iteration of NftCardContainer and NftCard
-   Added the getCitizenForWallet route to alchemy.js
-   Need to work on what I want the app to actually look like. Side navbar or top header? Do I even need a header? The MVP is to allow a citizen to connect their wallet, verify that they have a citizen NFT, grant access to lore generator, use chatgpt to create a background for the citizen based on the nft's traits, then allow the citizen to share on twitter

### 2023-12-28

-   Consolidated the front and backend repos under 1 main repository and made first push to GitHub.
-   Troubleshooting the .env files with React. Each server will need to have their own `.env.development` and `.env.production`.
-   Created an [`AlchemyDataService`](./frontend/src/services/alchemy.js) class but it does not render the images like the [interfaces.js](./frontend/src/components/interfaces.js).
-

### 2023-12-27

Frontend

-   Created .env.development.local to begin routing API to the backend.
-   Created interface to pull nfts for a wallet address and display them in browser.

### 2023-12-26

Backend

-   Created route for getting a wallet's citizens. This is not the "best" way to do it, but it works for now. Will look into the most secure way to do so. Most likely will be within a smart contract itself.
    Middleware
-   Not sure what to do with this...
    Frontend
-   Need to remove the middleware calls and reroute to the backend.

### 2023-12-23

Backend

-   I tried to mimic the net2dev demo from youtube with having a middleware outside the backend, but there was some content missing and I'm not sure if it was because that developer was using Next.js instead of React.
-   Created the nftController that returns all of the nfts for a given address.

### 2023-12-07

Backend

-   Created index.js
-   Created server.js
-   Created ./api/router.js
-   My original thoughts were to mimic the NetDex Project I made which implemented a Controller/DAO approach to routing API calls.
    Frontend
-   Initialized frontend.
-   Created interface for handling middleware.

### 2023-12-05

Backend

-   Created logic for pulling all nfts from an address and parsing through them.

-   Added new feature XYZ.
-   Fixed bug ABC.

-   Fixed the alchemyDataService in Frontend. I needed to set the methods to `async` and then `await` the calls.
-   Created first iteration of Header.
-   Created first iteration of NftCardContainer and NftCard
-   Added the getCitizenForWallet route to alchemy.js
-   Need to work on what I want the app to actually look like. Side navbar or top header? Do I even need a header?
